                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> This article gave me inspiration for the many ways I can design. For example, adding animations between different functions makes interactions feel seamless. I also got a feel for different kinds of interfaces based on their color palette, typography, and organization. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was the "Prism studio" design. I liked the simple black and white color palette and the scroll animations. I also liked "Netflix dark" design because you could swipe to move the image. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite design was the "Prism Studio" design because I thought that the black and white color palette conveyed their studio well. I associate black and white with tattoos, and their web design elevated the quality of their studio. I also appreciated the consistency of their design. As you scroll down, images and text swipe out from left to right, which makes their site very legible. </p>

                            <p> This article was a 7 for me because it had a wide variety of designs for inspiration. However, I would have appreciated some text descriptions of each design, such as what makes each design so good. </p>
