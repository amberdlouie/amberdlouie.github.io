        <ul>
            <li>I learned that there are different design choices that emphasize certain hierarchies, content, intention, and audiences. For example, Twitter emphasizes the retweets and like count with bolder text, which highlights what information the audience may want to know.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was breaking down the Spotify app. I didn't realize how much organizing must have went into the app in order to better serve its specific users.</li>
            <li>"Know the rules, so you can break em"</li>
            <li>I rate this reading an 8 because it was informative and had good examples for different design choice reasonings.</li>
