							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Padding is the white space of a website. Establishing rules for padding can help brings clarity and balance to a layout by creating intentionality and consistency. Greater padding brings greater emphasis on an element. Padding should be considered in every design process. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when they addressed the common concerns around white space. I realize that white space is not wasted space. Condensing everything into one page is not always the most efficient use of space and can rather make the legibility of a site more confusing and cluttered. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> White space is not wasted space. </p>
