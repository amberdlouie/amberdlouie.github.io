					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <img src="assets/imgs/wireframe info page.png"> </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p><a href="https://www.designbyroka.com/"> Design by Roka </a></p>
							<p> This is a website for Shawn Park's portfolio. The site informs users about who Shawn Park is, such as his interests and design perspective, and showcases his past projects related to design. The main page of the site starts with a short introduction of himself and then links to his past projects. He also has a lot of other links and information related to him and design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I looked at the bio description section of his page, which had a lot of text in the same sized font and padding. My redesign addresses the hierarchy of text information by centering the texts instead of the image Sean Park. I established order by enlarging the name and job title section and the job description section to emphasize what parts of his introduction were important to read. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
