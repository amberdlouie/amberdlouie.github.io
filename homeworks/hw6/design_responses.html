						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Duration of animation should be slow enough for users to notice the change, but not too slow where users have to wait. The optimal speed for interface animations is 200-500 ms. Mobile devices last 200-300ms, while tablets are around 400-500ms because the screen size is bigger. Animations should also move with some acceleration or deceleration to look more real. We should refer to ease-in acceleration and ease-out deceleration curves. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was about subordinate interaction. The animations and movements of other elements follow the order of one central object to draw more attention to the main content. It makes sense for objects to be animated in accordance with the laws of physics and are pretty orderly so that users can better experience the design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>  the animation in the interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world â€” friction, acceleration, etc. Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface. </p>
						</li>
