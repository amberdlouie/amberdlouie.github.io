							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Typography contributes to the mood, tone, and style of designs. Typography type should take into account the information about the users of your design, such as their age, interests, and cultural upbringing. Fonts should keep in mind the readbility, legibility, and purpose. You should research a font's intended purpose. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was learning about the intended purpose behind certain fonts. I didn't realize how impactful fonts could be to the legibility and expression different fonts had. For example, I didn't know Sassoon Primary was better suited for children because of its high legibility and letter shape. </p>
