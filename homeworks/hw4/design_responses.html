					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The background-to-text contrast ratio should be at least 4:5:1. You should not solely rely on color for crucial system information, but rather include iconography and messaging in conjunction with color. You should give your team the ability to reference the color system so that everyone is clear about using it properly. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was how it stressed the importance of accessible design, which includes designing for users with disabilities. It's important to have options for color blind people, such as putting different textures over different colors. The contrast ratio of the color system is also important to keep in mind so that the colors are legible to all users.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

						</li>
